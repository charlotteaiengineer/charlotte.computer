**Unresearched theory**: The human brain learns overtime through a similar mechanism to Backpropagation in Neural Networks, tweaking weights with each new experience. NEw perspectives in real time tweak weights. 

Learning rate is perhaps tied to IQ, generally can be influenced by drugs, caffeine and alcohol for better or worse. 

Magic mushrooms appear to have substantial affect; it *feels* like a rewiring of the brain. In other words - turning the brain into a malleable state and coming out of the experience changed (with new weights relayed into the system)

Trauma - specifically the extreme type during early development (we can take Ed Gein's tragic case for example) COULD be a catastrophic change of the system as a whole. Where we take the idea of usual learning rate, this event could be a huge learning rate change, which would force the system out of the current local minima into an entriely new one.

The brain during trauma gears itself up to predict the traumatic event happening again, but the next time it would be prepared - basic survival mechanism. The weights and connections have been formed around the event, cemented into the system. 

The person now has a new configuration of the brain, a new global minima formed.
