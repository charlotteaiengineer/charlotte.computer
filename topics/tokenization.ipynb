      "The scaling up of AI models has two major consequences. First, AI models are becoming more powerful and capable of more tasks, enabling more applications. More people and teams leverage AI to increase productivity, create economic value, and improve quality of life. Second, training large language models (LLMs) requires data, compute resources, and specialized talent that only a few organizations can afford. This has led to the emergence of model as a service: models developed by these few organizations are made available for others to use as a service. Anyone who wishes to leverage AI to build applications can now use these models to do so without having to invest up front in building a model. In short, the demand for AI applications has increased while the barrier to entry for building AI applications has decreased. This has turned AI engineering—the process of building applications on top of readily available models—into one of the fastest-growing engineering disciplines. Building applications on top of machine learning (ML) models isn’t new. Long before LLMs became prominent, AI was already powering many applications, including product recommendations, fraud detection, and churn prediction. While many principles of productionizing AI applications remain the same, the new generation of large-scale, readily available models brings about new possibilities and new challenges, which are the focus of this book. This chapter begins with an overview of foundation models, the key catalyst behind the explosion of AI engineering. I’ll then discuss a range of successful AI use cases, each illustrating what AI is good and not yet good at. As AI’s capabilities expand daily, predicting its future possibilities becomes increasingly challenging. However, existing application patterns can help uncover opportunities today and offer clues about how AI may continue to be used in the future. To close out the chapter, I’ll provide an overview of the new AI stack, including what has changed with foundation models, what remains the same, and how the role of an AI engineer today differs from that of a traditional ML engineer.\n",

    "text = \"The scaling up of AI models has two major consequences. First, AI models are becoming more powerful and capable of more tasks, enabling more applications. More people and teams leverage AI to increase productivity, create economic value, and improve quality of life. Second, training large language models (LLMs) requires data, compute resources, and specialized talent that only a few organizations can afford. This has led to the emergence of model as a service: models developed by these few organizations are made available for others to use as a service. Anyone who wishes to leverage AI to build applications can now use these models to do so without having to invest up front in building a model. In short, the demand for AI applications has increased while the barrier to entry for building AI applications has decreased. This has turned AI engineering—the process of building applications on top of readily available models—into one of the fastest-growing engineering disciplines. Building applications on top of machine learning (ML) models isn’t new. Long before LLMs became prominent, AI was already powering many applications, including product recommendations, fraud detection, and churn prediction. While many principles of productionizing AI applications remain the same, the new generation of large-scale, readily available models brings about new possibilities and new challenges, which are the focus of this book. This chapter begins with an overview of foundation models, the key catalyst behind the explosion of AI engineering. I’ll then discuss a range of successful AI use cases, each illustrating what AI is good and not yet good at. As AI’s capabilities expand daily, predicting its future possibilities becomes increasingly challenging. However, existing application patterns can help uncover opportunities today and offer clues about how AI may continue to be used in the future. To close out the chapter, I’ll provide an overview of the new AI stack, including what has changed with foundation models, what remains the same, and how the role of an AI engineer today differs from that of a traditional ML engineer.\"\n",

      "The scaling up of AI models has two major consequences. First, AI models are becoming more powerful and capable of more tasks, enabling more applications. More people and teams leverage AI to increase productivity, create economic value, and improve quality of life. Second, training large language models (LLMs) requires data, compute resources, and specialized talent that only a few organizations can afford. This has led to the emergence of model as a service: models developed by these few organizations are made available for others to use as a service. Anyone who wishes to leverage AI to build applications can now use these models to do so without having to invest up front in building a model. In short, the demand for AI applications has increased while the barrier to entry for building AI applications has decreased. This has turned AI engineering—the process of building applications on top of readily available models—into one of the fastest-growing engineering disciplines. Building applications on top of machine learning (ML) models isn’t new. Long before LLMs became prominent, AI was already powering many applications, including product recommendations, fraud detection, and churn prediction. While many principles of productionizing AI applications remain the same, the new generation of large-scale, readily available models brings about new possibilities and new challenges, which are the focus of this book. This chapter begins with an overview of foundation models, the key catalyst behind the explosion of AI engineering. I’ll then discuss a range of successful AI use cases, each illustrating what AI is good and not yet good at. As AI’s capabilities expand daily, predicting its future possibilities becomes increasingly challenging. However, existing application patterns can help uncover opportunities today and offer clues about how AI may continue to be used in the future. To close out the chapter, I’ll provide an overview of the new AI stack, including what has changed with foundation models, what remains the same, and how the role of an AI engineer today differs from that of a traditional ML engineer.\n",
